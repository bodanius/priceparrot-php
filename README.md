# Price Parrot â€“ Competitor price monitoring

## About the API
We find automation really important for any modern business. Therefore we include free API access for every package we offer. Our web API is based on the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) protocol with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. You can simply integrate competitor prices and price suggesions from Price Parrot into your e-commerce software, such as Shopify, Magento, Opencart or CSCart.

## Why you might need it
It is vital in e-commerce to keep pace with price movements. Overpricing your products may result in loss of customers to your competition, whilst underpricing may result in a loss of revenue. Our price monitor makes sure your pricing stays up-to-date with the market.

## Installation & loading
The code is also available via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install the Price Parrot API. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"priceparrot/priceparrot": "^1"
```

or run

```sh
composer require priceparrot/priceparrot
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of Price Parrot.

## A Simple Example

```php
<?php
//Import Price Parrot classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use PriceParrot\PriceParrotClient;

//Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create an instance with api key and secret (find these here https://backend.priceparrot.io/api)
$priceparrot = new PriceParrotClient($apikey, $secret);

try {
    $product = $priceparrot->FetchProduct('123');
    echo '<pre>' . print_r($product, true) . '</pre>';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "There was a problem loading the product";
}
```
